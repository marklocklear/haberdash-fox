h1 About Haberdash Fox

.detail.description
  p The desire of The Haberdash Fox is to encourage people to buy quality vintage and unique goods. We believe the value of vintage goods isn't solely in their function, but also in their history. We believe using the goods we already have is important for preserving our natural resources and reducing the impact manufacturing can have on our planet. We also desire to support artisan entrepreneurs. And what better place to find both vintage and unique goods than Etsy? But finding quality on Etsy can be time consuming and difficult. So we've done the work for you and currated a selection of quality goods that are for sale on Etsy. All items on this site are available for purchase. And no additional costs are associated with finding goods on The Haberdash Fox.
